# Walmart Sales Data Analysis

A comprehensive analysis of Walmart’s sales dataset using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn. This project showcases skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and profitability insights.

Author - Het Shah

## Objective

To analyze sales trends and patterns in Walmart transactional data and extract actionable insights, such as:

- Which product categories generate the most revenue?
- What are the busiest sales periods?
- Which cities are most profitable?
- How do variables like quantity, unit price, and payment methods correlate?

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Pandas** – data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – data visualization

---

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicate entries
- Converted currency and string values to numeric
- Parsed dates and times into proper formats
- Handled missing/null values

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Extracted day, month, year, and time from the timestamp
- Created new metrics: `total_revenue`, `total_profit`, etc.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Frequency analysis of:
  - Product categories
  - Cities
  - Payment methods
- Sales trend analysis over time
- Profitability by category and location

### 4. Visualizations
- Line plots for revenue trends
- Bar plots for top categories/cities
- Correlation heatmaps

## Key Findings

- **Top Categories:** The most profitable product categories by total sales.
- **Peak Times:** Sales are highest during evenings and weekends.
- **City Insights:** Some cities consistently outperform others in revenue and profit.
- **Customer Behavior:** Card payments dominate, and purchase quantities tend to increase during promotions.
